# Tiff's Treats Point-of-Sale System

## Overview
This Tiff's Treats Point-of-Sale system was created as part of my Programming Studio course CSCE 315 at Texas A&M University for which me and a group of three others put together a web application with various functionalites such as traversing the website to view menu items as well as ordering page regardless of a user logging in or not, manager permissions like viewing tables, admin permissions like modifying the permissinos of all other users. The website allows for uesrs to order items as well as view their order; in addition to this, the final product of the web application achieved an 89% user accessibilty score. 

The POS system uses a combination of React as well as Node.js for the frontend and backend respectively to achieve a complete full stack project; the frontend also included plenty of HTML and CSS to help with the styling of the website while the backend incorporated many API route calls as well as connected to a database via postgreSQL.
